An MC module I am developing to simulate semicrystalline polymer degradation kinetics. It has two parts - the first one is a Python Class (see the file 'create_configurations.ipynb') that creates all the configurations of ties, loops, and tails inside the amorphous region, whereas the second is the second code performs the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for their degradation.
