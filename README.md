A Monte Carlo-type module to simulate semicrystalline polymer degradation kinetics. It has two parts - the first one is a Python Class (see the file 'create_configurations.ipynb') that creates all the configurations of ties, loops, and tails inside the amorphous region, whereas the second code (KMC_Reaction_I.ipynb) performs the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for their degradation and performs preliminary data analysis.
