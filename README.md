# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Module
A MC module I am developing to simulate polymer degradation kinetics. It has two classes - the first one creates all the configurations of ties, loops, and tails inside the amorphous region whereas the second class runs a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for their degradation.
